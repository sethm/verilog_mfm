Verilog MFM Decoder
===================

This project contains an extermely sketchy and very experimental MFM
decoder module written in Verilog.

It's really not ready yet.

Building
========

This should build reasonably well on any UNIX-like system. Possibly
even Windows, if you're brave. I haven't tried. You'll need Icarus
Verilog (http://iverilog.icarus.com/) to compile it. The default
Makefile also wants to build a graph using gnuplot, so grab that too.
